# 🎯 Early Mover Detection Signals - Complete System

## ✅ Implemented Signals

### 1. **Volume Surge Detection** (Multi-Timeframe)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What it does**: Identifies coins with unusual volume spikes before price moves

**Timeframes**: 1h + 4h (dual confirmation)

**API Endpoint**: `/api/volume-surges`

**Signal Strength**:
- 🚀 **VERY_STRONG**: Both 1h AND 4h showing surges (highest priority)
- 🔥 **STRONG**: High surge on one timeframe
- ⚡ **MEDIUM**: Moderate signals
- 📊 **WEAK**: Early/weak signals

**Key Metrics**:
- Surge multiplier (current vs 7-day average)
- Volume trend (accelerating/stable/declining)
- Price stability filter (catches accumulation before pump)
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Market cap filter (default <$500M)

**Default Returns**: Top 5 most confident signals

**Documentation**: `VOLUME_SURGE_DETECTION.md`

### 2. **Breakout Scanner** (Pattern Detection)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

**What it does**: Detects coins breaking out of tight consolidation patterns with volume confirmation

**Timeframes**: 72h+ consolidation analysis

**API Endpoint**: `/api/breakout-scanner`

**Signal Strength**:
- 💥 **VERY_STRONG**: Tight squeeze (<5% range) + strong breakout + high volume + fresh (≤2h)
- 🚀 **STRONG**: Good pattern + decent breakout + volume confirmation
- ⚡ **MEDIUM**: Valid pattern with moderate confirmation
- 📊 **WEAK**: Weak patterns or aged breakouts

**Key Metrics**:
- Consolidation range % (tighter = better)
- Breakout strength (% beyond range)
- Volume increase vs consolidation average
- Hours since breakout (fresher = higher probability)
- Pattern type (Tight Squeeze / Consolidation / Range)
- Market cap filter (default <$500M)

**Patterns Detected**:
- Bollinger Band Squeeze
- Support/Resistance Breaks
- Triangle/Wedge Breakouts

**Default Returns**: Top 5 most confident breakouts

**Documentation**: `BREAKOUT_SCANNER.md`

## 🚀 Next Recommended Signals to Implement

### 3. **Order Book Imbalance Detector** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why**: Real-time whale activity, immediate signal

**What to track**:
- Bid/Ask ratio (>70/30 = bullish pressure)
- Large walls appearing/disappearing
- Top-of-book depth changes
- Aggressive market orders

**Implementation**:
```python
GET /api/orderbook-imbalance?min_imbalance=65&min_wall_size=50000
```

**Metrics**:
- Bid volume / Total volume ratio
- Wall strength (size vs avg)
- Imbalance persistence (seconds)
- Buy/Sell aggression ratio

**Signal Types**:
- 🐋 Whale accumulation (big bids)
- 💨 Resistance break (walls eaten)
- ⚠️ Distribution (big asks)

---

### 3. **Multi-Timeframe Momentum Alignment** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Why**: Higher accuracy when all timeframes agree

**What to track**:
- 15m, 1h, 4h trends all bullish/bearish
- Moving average alignment (price > SMA on all TF)
- RSI confirmation across timeframes
- Volume increasing on each higher TF

**Implementation**:
```python
GET /api/momentum-alignment?timeframes=15m,1h,4h
```

**Scoring**:
- 3/3 aligned = VERY STRONG (90-100% confidence)
- 2/3 aligned = STRONG (70-89%)
- 1/3 aligned = WEAK (< 70%)

**Metrics**:
- Trend direction per TF
- Alignment score (0-100%)
- Trend strength (slope magnitude)
- Volume confirmation

---

### 4. **Breakout Scanner** ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why**: Catches moves when price exits consolidation

**What to track**:
- Bollinger Band squeezes (low volatility)
- Triangle/wedge patterns
- Support/resistance breaks
- Volume expansion on breakout

**Implementation**:
```python
GET /api/breakouts?consolidation_days=3&min_breakout_pct=2
```

**Metrics**:
- Consolidation duration (longer = stronger)
- Breakout strength (% above resistance)
- Volume ratio (breakout vs average)
- Retest success (price holds above)

**Signal Types**:
- 🔓 Fresh breakout (< 1 hour)
- ✅ Confirmed breakout (retested successfully)
- ⚠️ False breakout (falling back)

---

### 5. **Funding Rate Divergence** (Futures) ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why**: Identifies trapped positions before reversals

**What to track**:
- Extreme funding rates (>0.1% or <-0.1%)
- Funding vs price divergence
- Long/short ratio extremes
- Liquidation cascades

**Implementation**:
```python
GET /api/funding-divergence?min_extreme=0.08
```

**Metrics**:
- Funding rate %
- Days at extreme levels
- Open interest changes
- Liquidation levels

**Signal Types**:
- 🔄 Mean reversion setup (extreme funding + stable price)
- ⚡ Momentum continuation (funding + price aligned)
- 💥 Squeeze potential (high OI + extreme funding)

---

### 6. **Composite "Big Mover Score"** ⭐ LOW PRIORITY (Combine all above first)
**Why**: Ultimate signal combining all factors

**What it does**: Aggregates scores from all individual signals

**Formula**:
```python
composite_score = (
    volume_surge_score * 0.30 +
    orderbook_score * 0.25 +
    momentum_alignment * 0.20 +
    breakout_score * 0.15 +
    funding_divergence * 0.10
)
```

**Implementation**:
```python
GET /api/big-mover-score?min_score=70
```

**Returns**: Only coins scoring 70+ (highest probability moves)

## 💡 Trading Strategy Integration

### How to Use Multiple Signals

**Entry Criteria** (wait for 2+ signals):
1. Volume surge (STRONG or VERY_STRONG) ✅
2. Order book imbalance (>65% bids)
3. Momentum aligned (2+ timeframes)

**Confirmation** (optional 3rd signal):
4. Breakout from consolidation
5. Funding rate extreme (for contrarian plays)

**Example Perfect Setup**:
```
Symbol: XYZUSDT
1. ✅ Volume Surge: VERY_STRONG (both 1h+4h surging)
2. ✅ Order Book: 72% bid pressure (whales accumulating)
3. ✅ Momentum: 3/3 timeframes bullish
4. ✅ Breakout: Just broke 3-day consolidation
→ Composite Score: 95/100 🚀

Action: ENTER LONG with tight stop
```
