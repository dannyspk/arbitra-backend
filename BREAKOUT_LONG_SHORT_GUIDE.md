# Breakout Scanner - Long & Short Position Support

## Overview
The Breakout Scanner now supports **both LONG and SHORT positions** with an intelligent direction filter.

## Breakout Types

### üöÄ BULLISH Breakouts (Long Positions)
**Detection**: Price breaks **ABOVE** consolidation high with volume

**Trading Strategy**:
- **Entry**: When price breaks above the consolidation range
- **Stop Loss**: Just below consolidation high (previous resistance becomes support)
- **Target**: 2-3x consolidation range height
- **Best For**: Bullish market conditions, accumulation patterns

**Example**:
```
Consolidation: $1.00 - $1.10 (10% range)
Breakout: Price moves to $1.12+ (breaks above $1.10)
Signal: BULLISH - Go LONG
Stop: $1.09 (below breakout level)
Target: $1.30+ (2-3x the $0.10 range)
```

---

### üìâ BEARISH Breakouts (Short Positions)
**Detection**: Price breaks **BELOW** consolidation low with volume

**Trading Strategy**:
- **Entry**: When price breaks below the consolidation range
- **Stop Loss**: Just above consolidation low (previous support becomes resistance)
- **Target**: 2-3x consolidation range height (downward)
- **Best For**: Bearish market conditions, distribution patterns

**Example**:
```
Consolidation: $1.00 - $1.10 (10% range)
Breakout: Price moves to $0.98 (breaks below $1.00)
Signal: BEARISH - Go SHORT
Stop: $1.01 (above breakout level)

## Advanced Patterns

### Bullish Reversal Breakout
**Setup**: Extended downtrend ‚Üí tight consolidation ‚Üí bullish breakout

**Indicators**:
- Long consolidation (72h+)
- Very tight squeeze (<3%)
- Heavy volume on breakout (>3x)
- Fresh signal (‚â§2h)

**Confidence**: Often VERY_STRONG (>80%)

---

### Bearish Reversal Breakout
**Setup**: Extended uptrend ‚Üí tight consolidation ‚Üí bearish breakdown

**Indicators**:
- Distribution phase visible
- Declining volume during consolidation
- Heavy selling on breakdown
- Quick breakdown (sudden)

**Confidence**: Often VERY_STRONG (>80%)

---

## Confidence Scoring (Same for Both)

Both bullish and bearish breakouts use the same confidence algorithm:

1. **Tightness** (35 points): How compressed the consolidation is
2. **Strength** (30 points): How far price breaks from range
3. **Volume** (25 points): Volume confirmation strength
4. **Freshness** (10 points): How recent the breakout is

**Total**: 0-100% confidence

## Best Practices

### For Long Positions (Bullish)
‚úÖ **DO**:
- Trade in uptrending markets
- Wait for pullback to broken resistance
- Confirm with volume
- Use wider stops in volatile coins

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Chase after extended moves (>6h old)
- Ignore volume confirmation
- Over-leverage on weak patterns (>7% range)
- Enter without clear stop loss

---

### For Short Positions (Bearish)
‚úÖ **DO**:
- Trade in downtrending markets
- Wait for bounce to broken support
- Confirm with selling volume
- Be ready to exit quickly (shorts riskier)

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Short during strong uptrends
- Hold shorts without stops
- Ignore short squeeze risk
- Short low liquidity coins

---

## Market Cap Considerations

**Both Long & Short**:
- **<$100M (Micro-cap)**: Highest volatility, biggest moves, highest risk
- **$100M-$500M (Small-mid cap)**: Good balance of movement and liquidity
- **>$500M (Large cap)**: Lower volatility, safer but smaller moves

**Default Filter**: $500M max (mid-low caps for best opportunities)

---

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Spot Trader
**Account Type**: Spot only (no shorting capability)

**Settings**:
```
direction=bullish
max_market_cap=200000000
consolidation_hours=72
```

**Strategy**: Only long positions on small caps with strong patterns

---

### Use Case 2: Futures Trader
**Account Type**: Futures/Margin (can short)

**Settings**:
```
direction=both
max_market_cap=500000000
min_volume_increase=2.0
```

**Strategy**: Trade both directions based on market conditions

---

### Use Case 3: Bear Market Specialist
**Account Type**: Short-focused

**Settings**:
```
direction=bearish
max_market_cap=1000000000
consolidation_hours=96
```

**Strategy**: Find distribution patterns in mid-large caps for safer shorts
