# üíæ Trade Persistence Solution

## Problem
Railway restarts ‚Üí Dashboard data (signals, trades, positions) is lost (stored in memory)

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: CSV File Storage (Simplest - 10 min to implement)
Store trades in a CSV file that persists across restarts

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Super simple
- ‚úÖ No database needed
- ‚úÖ Can download CSV to analyze
- ‚úÖ Works on Railway's free tier

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è File storage on Railway is ephemeral (lost if volume unmounted)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not great for high frequency

**Implementation:**
```python
# In live_dashboard.py
import csv
import os

TRADES_FILE = 'trades_history.csv'

def save_trade_to_csv(trade):
    file_exists = os.path.exists(TRADES_FILE)
    with open(TRADES_FILE, 'a', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=[...])
        if not file_exists:
            writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerow(asdict(trade))

def load_trades_from_csv():
    if not os.path.exists(TRADES_FILE):
        return []
    # Load and return trades
```

### Option 2: SQLite Database (Better - 30 min to implement)
Use SQLite (no external DB needed, file-based)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Proper database
- ‚úÖ Fast queries
- ‚úÖ No external service needed
- ‚úÖ Works offline

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Railway might clear on redeploy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to mount persistent volume

**Implementation:**
```python
import sqlite3

def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('trades.db')
    conn.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trades (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            symbol TEXT,
            side TEXT,
            entry_price REAL,
            exit_price REAL,
            pnl REAL,
            pnl_pct REAL,
            entry_time INTEGER,
            exit_time INTEGER,
            reason TEXT
        )
    ''')
    conn.commit()
```

### Option 3: PostgreSQL (Production - Railway built-in)
Use Railway's PostgreSQL add-on

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ True persistence
- ‚úÖ Survives all restarts
- ‚úÖ Scalable
- ‚úÖ Railway provides free tier

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to learn SQL/ORM

**Railway Setup:**
1. Add PostgreSQL service in Railway
2. Connect with SQLAlchemy
3. Auto-provision database URL

### Option 4: Redis (Fast caching)
Use Redis for fast in-memory storage with persistence

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Fast
- ‚úÖ Railway has Redis add-on
- ‚úÖ Persistence options

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Another service to manage

## üéØ My Recommendation for You

### **For Now (Next 48 hours):**
Just let it run without restarting! You'll collect trade data.

### **For Long Term:**
**Use SQLite** - Here's why:
- Simple to implement (30 min)
- No external dependencies
- Good for your trading volume
- Easy to export/analyze

---

## üöÄ Quick Implementation (SQLite)

Want me to implement this? I can:

1. Add SQLite database to store trades
2. Auto-load trades on startup (survive restarts)
3. Keep existing in-memory for real-time updates
4. Sync to DB on every trade completion
5. Add endpoint to download all trades as CSV

**Time: 30 minutes**

Say the word and I'll do it! üí™

## üìä Current Workaround

**For your immediate need:**

1. **Don't restart Railway** for next 24-48 hours
2. Let strategies generate signals and complete trades
3. Monitor with the dashboard
4. Once you have good data, we can add persistence

**Or:**

Start fresh now with logging enabled, and in 24 hours you'll have:
- All new signals recorded
- All new trades recorded  
- Full history to analyze
- Then we add persistence before next restart

What do you want to do?
1. Just let it run and collect data?
2. Add SQLite persistence now?
3. Add CSV export for now?
