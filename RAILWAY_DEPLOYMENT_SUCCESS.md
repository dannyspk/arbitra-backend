## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Dockerfile vs Nixpacks ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Railway was using Dockerfile with wrong app path  
**Solution**: Renamed Dockerfile to Dockerfile.backup, Railway now uses Nixpacks  
**Result**: Build successful

### Issue 2: Missing Environment Variables ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `ENCRYPTION_KEY` not set in environment variables  
**Solution**: Added all required environment variables via Railway dashboard  
**Result**: App starts successfully

### Issue 3: Health Check Failures ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Service unavailable during startup  
**Solution**: Fixed both Dockerfile path and environment variables  
**Result**: Health checks passing

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Health Check
```bash
curl https://arbitra-backend-production-fa5e.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### Test User Registration
1. Go to: https://arbitra-backend-production-fa5e.up.railway.app/docs
2. Find `/api/auth/register` endpoint
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Enter:
   ```json
   {
     "username": "testuser",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "password": "SecurePass123!"
   }
   ```
5. Click "Execute"
6. Should receive `access_token` in response

### Test User Login
1. Go to `/api/auth/login` endpoint
2. Enter username and password
3. Receive new `access_token`

### Test Protected Endpoint
1. Copy the `access_token`
2. Go to `/api/auth/me` endpoint
3. Click "Authorize" button (🔒)
4. Paste token: `Bearer {your_token}`
5. Click "Try it out" → "Execute"
6. Should return your user info

## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Test All Endpoints ⏳
- [ ] Test user registration
- [ ] Test user login
- [ ] Test API key management
- [ ] Test protected endpoints
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections

### 2. Update Frontend ⏳
```javascript
// In your frontend config
const API_BASE_URL = "https://arbitra-backend-production-fa5e.up.railway.app";
```

Files to update:
- `web/frontend/.env.production`
- `web/frontend/src/config.ts`

### 3. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional) ⏳
Follow: `AUTOMATIC_DEPLOYMENTS_SETUP.md`

Steps:
