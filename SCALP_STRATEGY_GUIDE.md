## üìä Technical Indicators Used

### 1. **Moving Averages**
- **SMA (6-period)**: Primary entry signal
- **Trend SMA (30-period)**: Longer-term trend filter

### 2. **Volatility**
- **Rolling Volatility (6-period)**: Adjusts position size
- Higher volatility = smaller position size
- Lower volatility = larger position size (up to max)

### 3. **Support/Resistance**
- **Pivot Points**: Local highs and lows within 20-bar window
- **ATR Bands**: Dynamic support/resistance levels
- Only enters near support (longs) or resistance (shorts)

### 4. **Momentum**
- **Short-term (6-period)**: Confirms entry direction
- **12h/24h momentum**: Filters against strong counter-trends

### 5. **Funding Rate** (Futures only)
- Nudges direction based on perpetual swap funding
- Positive funding ‚Üí Short bias
- Negative funding ‚Üí Long bias

## üìà Entry Logic

### Long Entry Conditions
‚úÖ Price < SMA AND slope positive (mean reversion)
‚úÖ Price near support level (within 0.5%)
‚úÖ Positive short-term momentum
‚úÖ Longer-term trend not strongly bearish
‚úÖ Position size adjusted by volatility

### Short Entry Conditions
‚úÖ Price > SMA AND slope negative (mean reversion)
‚úÖ Price near resistance level (within 0.5%)
‚úÖ Negative short-term momentum
‚úÖ Longer-term trend not strongly bullish
‚úÖ Position size adjusted by volatility

---

## üö™ Exit Logic

### Profit Exits
1. **Partial Exit** (50% position):
   - When P&L reaches +0.45%
   - Locks in some profit, lets rest run

2. **Full Exit** (remaining position):
   - When P&L reaches +0.9%
   - Take full profit and close

### Loss Exit
- **Stop Loss**: -1% P&L
- Immediate full exit to limit loss

### Time-Based Exit
- **Max Hold**: 60 minutes (60 bars on 1m timeframe)
- Forces exit even if not at target/stop
- Prevents holding stale positions

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. **Symbol Selection**
- ‚úÖ Choose liquid pairs (BTC, ETH, major alts)
- ‚úÖ Check 24h volume > $50M
- ‚ùå Avoid low-cap, illiquid tokens

### 2. **Market Conditions**
- ‚úÖ Works best in ranging/choppy markets
- ‚úÖ Mean reversion style benefits from oscillation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less effective in strong trending markets

### 3. **Risk Management**
- Start with 5% position sizing
- Max 3-5 concurrent positions
- Don't override stop losses
- Use paper trading first!

### 4. **Monitoring**
- Check Live Dashboard regularly
- Watch for repeated stop-outs
- Adjust parameters if needed

### 5. **Paper Trading First**
- **Always test in paper mode first**
- Strategy defaults to paper trading
- Set `ARB_LIVE_DEFAULT_EXEC_MODE=live` for real trades
- Monitor for at least 24 hours before going live

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Strategy Not Entering Trades
**Possible Causes:**
- Filters too strict (trend filter, momentum filter)
- Not enough price deviation from SMA
- Price not near support/resistance levels

**Solutions:**
- Lower `entry_threshold` to 0.006 (0.6%)
- Disable trend filter: `trend_filter=False`
- Increase `sr_threshold_pct` to 0.01 (1%)

### Too Many Stop-Outs
**Possible Causes:**
- High volatility
- Stop loss too tight
- Poor entry timing

**Solutions:**
- Increase `stop_loss` to 0.015 (1.5%)
- Let volatility scaling work (reduces size in high vol)
- Add momentum filter

### Positions Held Too Long
**Possible Causes:**
- Targets too far
- Time exit not triggering

**Solutions:**
- Lower `exit_target` to 0.007 (0.7%)
- Reduce `max_holding_bars` to 30 (30 minutes)

    stop_loss=0.008,             # Tighter stop
    max_holding_bars=30,         # Exit faster
    trend_filter=True,           # Only with trend
)
```

### Aggressive Scalper (More Trades)
```python
QuickScalpStrategy(
    notional_per_trade=200.0,    # Larger size
    entry_threshold=0.005,       # Enter on small moves
    exit_target=0.012,           # Let winners run
    stop_loss=0.015,             # Wider stop
    max_holding_bars=90,         # Hold longer
