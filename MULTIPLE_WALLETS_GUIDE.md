# Using Multiple Wallets - Quick Guide

## Overview
The platform supports both **MetaMask** and **Coinbase Wallet**. However, only one can be active at a time since both inject into the same browser interface (`window.ethereum`).

## Option 1: Use MetaMask (Recommended for most users)

If you see the error "MetaMask is currently active", simply:

1. **Click "Connect MetaMask"** instead of Coinbase Wallet
2. Approve the connection
3. You're done! ‚úÖ

## Option 2: Switch to Coinbase Wallet

If you specifically want to use Coinbase Wallet:

### Method A: Disable MetaMask temporarily
1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or browser extensions page)
2. Find **MetaMask** extension
3. Toggle it **OFF** (disable)
4. Refresh the page
5. Click **"Connect Coinbase Wallet"**
6. Approve the connection

### Method B: Use separate browser profiles
1. Create a new Chrome profile:
   - Click your profile icon ‚Üí "Add" ‚Üí "Continue without an account"
2. In the new profile:
   - Install only **Coinbase Wallet** extension
   - No MetaMask = No conflicts
3. Use this profile whenever you want Coinbase Wallet

### Method C: Use different browsers
- **Chrome/Brave** ‚Üí MetaMask
- **Firefox** ‚Üí Coinbase Wallet
- Keep them separated by browser

## Installing Coinbase Wallet

If you don't have Coinbase Wallet installed:

1. Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/downloads
2. Click **"Chrome Extension"** (or your browser)
3. Add to browser
4. Create or import your wallet
5. Return to the platform and click **"Connect Coinbase Wallet"**

## Which Wallet Should I Use?

### Use **MetaMask** if:
- ‚úÖ You're already familiar with it
- ‚úÖ You want the most popular option
- ‚úÖ You use many DeFi protocols (best compatibility)
- ‚úÖ You want advanced features and settings

### Use **Coinbase Wallet** if:
- ‚úÖ You have a Coinbase account and want integration
- ‚úÖ You prefer a simpler, cleaner interface
- ‚úÖ You want built-in NFT management
- ‚úÖ You're new to crypto (easier onboarding)

## Checking Which Wallet is Connected

Look at the icon next to your address:
- ü¶ä **Orange icon** = MetaMask
- üíº **Blue icon** = Coinbase Wallet
- üîê **Green icon** = Unknown wallet

## Switching Between Wallets

To switch from one wallet to another:

1. **Disconnect** current wallet (click "Disconnect" button)
2. **Disable** the current wallet extension (or switch browser profile)
3. **Click** the other wallet's connect button
4. **Approve** the connection

## Common Issues

### "Please switch to Coinbase Wallet or install it separately"
**Problem**: MetaMask is active, but you clicked Coinbase Wallet button

**Solutions**:
- Use MetaMask instead (easiest)
- Disable MetaMask and refresh page
- Install Coinbase Wallet if not installed

### "MetaMask not detected"
**Problem**: MetaMask extension is not installed or disabled

**Solutions**:
- Install from https://metamask.io/download
- Enable the extension if disabled
- Refresh the page after installation

### Both wallets installed, wrong one connects
**Problem**: Multiple wallet extensions conflict

**Solutions**:
- Disable unused wallet temporarily
- Use separate browser profiles (recommended)
- Use different browsers for different wallets

### Connection doesn't persist after refresh
**Problem**: Browser localStorage is disabled or cleared

**Solutions**:
- Enable cookies and site data in browser settings
- Check browser is not in incognito/private mode
- Whitelist the site in your privacy settings

## Security Tips
