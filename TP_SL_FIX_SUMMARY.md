# TP/SL Fix Summary - COAI Scalp Strategy Issue

## üêõ **Root Cause Analysis**

### **What Stopped Working:**
The COAIUSDT scalp strategy was previously generating signals but **stopped** because:

1. ‚úÖ **Strategy was saved to database** - Confirmed via `get_active_strategies()`
2. ‚ùå **Backend server was NOT running** - No Python processes found
3. ‚ùå **Auto-restoration never triggered** - Server needs to start to restore strategies

### **The TP/SL Bug (Separate Issue):**
When reviewing the code, we discovered a **critical bug** that was breaking position management:

#### **Bug Description:**
- **Bear/Bull modes:** ‚úÖ TP/SL checks existed in main loop (lines 285-354)
- **Scalp mode:** ‚ùå **NO TP/SL checks** - relied entirely on `QuickScalpStrategy.decide()`
- **Range mode:** ‚ùå **NO TP/SL checks** - relied entirely on `RangeGridStrategy.decide()`

#### **Impact:**
- Positions **were created** with `stop_loss` and `take_profit` values
- These values **were NEVER checked** for scalp/range modes
- Result: Positions could **exceed stop loss** or **miss take profit** levels
- The strategy classes would need to implement TP/SL logic themselves (inconsistent!)

---

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

### **Changes Made to `live_strategy.py`:**

#### **1. Scalp Mode (Line ~357):**
```python
# üîß FIX: Check TP/SL FIRST before strategy decision
tp_sl_triggered = False
if current_pos is not None:
    should_close = False
    close_reason = ''
    
    if current_pos.side == 'long':
        if price <= current_pos.stop_loss:
            should_close = True
            close_reason = 'stop_loss'
        elif price >= current_pos.take_profit:
            should_close = True
            close_reason = 'take_profit'
    else:  # short
        if price >= current_pos.stop_loss:
            should_close = True
            close_reason = 'stop_loss'
        elif price <= current_pos.take_profit:
            should_close = True
            close_reason = 'take_profit'
    
    if should_close:
        action_type = 'close_long' if current_pos.side == 'long' else 'close_short'
        act = self._make_action(action_type, price, None, close_reason)
        await self._emit_action(act)
        tp_sl_triggered = True

# Only run strategy decision if TP/SL didn't trigger
if not tp_sl_triggered:
    # ... existing strategy logic
```

#### **2. Range Mode (Line ~436):**
Applied the **same TP/SL check** before strategy decision logic.

### **Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ **Consistent TP/SL enforcement** across ALL modes (bear, bull, scalp, range)
2. ‚úÖ **Prevents runaway losses** - Stop loss is always respected
3. ‚úÖ **Locks in profits** - Take profit is always checked
4. ‚úÖ **Priority handling** - TP/SL is checked BEFORE strategy logic runs
5. ‚úÖ **Simplifies strategy classes** - They don't need to implement TP/SL themselves

## üöÄ **Server Status**

### **Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Backend server **IS NOW RUNNING** (started via terminal)
- ‚úÖ COAIUSDT scalp strategy **RESTORED FROM DATABASE**
- ‚úÖ Strategy is actively checking for signals:
  ```
  [LiveStrategy COAIUSDT] Closes buffer: 50 bars, current price: 4.57
  [Scalp] Checking decision... bars=50, need 40+
  ```

### **How Auto-Restoration Works:**
```python
@app.on_event('startup')
async def _on_startup():
    await _restore_strategies()  # Restores all active strategies from DB
```

**When server starts:**
1. Reads database for active strategies (`get_active_strategies()`)
2. Creates `LiveStrategy` instances for each
3. Calls `.start()` to resume trading

## üìä **TP/SL Parameters by Mode**

| Mode | Stop Loss | Take Profit | Position Size |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Bear** | 1.0% | 2.0% | 20% capital |
| **Bull** | 1.0% | 2.0% | 10% capital |
| **Scalp** | 0.4% | 0.5% | 15% capital |
| **Range** | 2.5% | 1.5% | 6% capital |

## üîç **Testing the Fix**

### **To Verify TP/SL is Working:**

1. **Start COAI scalp strategy** (already running)
2. **Wait for entry signal** (aggressive parameters should trigger soon)
3. **Monitor position in dashboard:**
   - Check `stop_loss` and `take_profit` values are set
   - Watch for automatic close when price hits TP/SL
4. **Check logs for:**
   ```
   [LiveStrategy] Trade completed: COAIUSDT long P&L=$X.XX (X.XX%)
   [TRADE SAVED] COAIUSDT long PnL=$X.XX
   ```

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Position opens when scalp strategy generates entry signal
- ‚úÖ Position closes automatically when:
  - Price hits stop loss (0.4% for scalp)
  - Price hits take profit (0.5% for scalp)
  - Strategy generates exit signal
- ‚úÖ Trade is saved to database with P&L
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows real-time P&L updates

---

## üìù **Code Quality Improvements**

### **Before:**
- Duplicate TP/SL logic in bear and bull modes
- Missing TP/SL logic in scalp and range modes
- Inconsistent position management

### **After:**
- ‚úÖ Unified TP/SL check pattern across all modes
- ‚úÖ Priority-based logic (TP/SL ‚Üí Strategy Decision)
- ‚úÖ Consistent position lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. ‚úÖ **Server is running** - Keep it running to monitor COAI signals
2. ‚è≥ **Wait for first signal** - Aggressive scalp parameters should trigger soon
3. ‚è≥ **Verify TP/SL execution** - Check that position closes at TP or SL
4. ‚è≥ **Review trade history** - Check database for saved trades

---

## üìå **Key Takeaways**

### **Why COAI Stopped:**
- Server was not running ‚Üí Auto-restoration never happened

### **Why TP/SL Wasn't Working:**
- Scalp/Range modes lacked TP/SL checks in main loop
- Strategy relied on external strategy classes to handle it
- Result: Positions could ignore TP/SL levels

### **What Changed:**
- Added TP/SL checks to **ALL** strategy modes
- TP/SL is now checked **BEFORE** strategy decision logic
- Consistent, reliable position management across all modes
