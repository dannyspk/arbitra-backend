### Multi-Vault Strategy
Track opportunities across protocols:
```

- Get notified when any spike
- Quick decision-making with mobile alerts
- Move capital to highest yield instantly
```

### Risk Management
Set defensive alerts:
```
- APY Drop 20% = Exit signal

- Check for "Outlier" flag = Unsustainable yield
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Q: Alert not triggering?**
- Check threshold settings
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Test webhook at webhook.site first
- Check server logs for errors

**Q: No historical data showing?**
- System needs 5-10 minutes to collect first data points
- Check back shortly after server starts
- Refresh page to load latest data

**Q: Position not updating?**
- Ensure wallet address is correct
- Position updates every time vault data refreshes (60s)
- Clear browser cache if stale

**Q: Can't see my vault?**
- Only shows vaults meeting criteria:
  - $10M+ TVL
  - 10%+ base APY
  - Stablecoin only
  - No impermanent loss risk

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Start Small:** Track 1-2 positions first
2. **Test Alerts:** Use webhook.site before Discord
3. **Check History:** Don't chase spikes without context
4. **Diversify:** Don't put everything in highest APY
5. **Monitor Outliers:** High APY = High risk often
6. **Set Realistic Thresholds:** Too sensitive = alert fatigue
7. **Update Positions:** Re-track when you rebalance
