## 📊 Current Status

**Your Current Branch:** `development` 🟢  
**Local Environment:** `development` mode  
**Security:** RELAXED (auth optional, no HTTPS required)

**Verify:**
```powershell
PS C:\arbitrage> git branch -a
* development
  main
  staging

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now):
- ✅ Branches created and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Environment configs ready
- ✅ Currently on development branch
- ✅ Ready for development work

### Soon (Next 1-2 hours):
1. **Set up Railway Projects**
   - Create 3 Railway projects
   - Link each to a branch
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Test Deployments**
   - Push to development → auto-deploy to dev
   - Merge to staging → auto-deploy to staging
   - Merge to main → auto-deploy to production

### Later (Next 4-6 hours):
3. **Integrate Security into web.py** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Add authentication to endpoints
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Protect WebSocket connections
   - Use encryption module

4. **Build Frontend Auth UI** (2-3 days)
   - Login page
   - Registration page
   - API key management

## 🔄 How to Work with Branches

### Daily Development:
```powershell
# Make sure you're on development
git checkout development

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin development

# Make changes, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin development
```

### Promote to Staging:
```powershell
# Switch to staging
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

# Merge development
git merge development

# Push to trigger staging deployment
git push origin staging

# Test at: https://staging-api.arbitra.com
```

### Deploy to Production:
```powershell
# ONLY after staging tests pass!
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge staging (NOT development!)
git merge staging

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"

# Push to trigger production deployment
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 📋 Railway Setup Guide

### Create 3 Projects on Railway:

#### Project 1: arbitra-prod
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Environment:** Copy all values from `.env.production`
- **Domain:** `api.arbitra.com`
- **Auto-deploy:** ✅ Enabled

#### Project 2: arbitra-staging
- **Branch:** `staging`
- **Environment:** Copy all values from `.env.staging`
- **Domain:** `staging-api.arbitra.com`
- **Auto-deploy:** ✅ Enabled

#### Project 3: arbitra-dev (optional)
- **Branch:** `development`
- **Environment:** Copy all values from `.env.development`
- **Domain:** `dev-api.arbitra.com`
- **Auto-deploy:** ✅ Enabled

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Before Deploying to Production:
- [ ] Generate new JWT_SECRET_KEY (production)
- [ ] Generate new ENCRYPTION_KEY (production)
- [ ] Update CORS_ORIGINS with real domains
- [ ] Remove default Binance API keys
- [ ] Test all security features on staging
- [ ] Enable HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Create database backups

### Security Integration Status:
- ✅ Security modules built and tested
- ✅ Environment separation configured
- ❌ **NOT yet integrated into web.py** ⚠️
- ❌ **No frontend authentication UI** ⚠️

**You CANNOT safely go to production until security is integrated!**

---

## 🛡️ Protect Your Branches (Recommended)

### On GitHub:
1. Go to: `https://github.com/dannyspk/arbitra-backend/settings/branches`
2. Add rule for `main`:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Require branch to be up to date

This prevents accidental direct commits to production.

**Great work! Your repository now has a professional multi-environment workflow.** 🎉

**Would you like me to:**
1. Help set up the Railway deployments?
2. Start integrating security into web.py? (CRITICAL for production)
3. Create the frontend authentication UI?
