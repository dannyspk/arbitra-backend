# Paper Trading Strategy - Debug Summary

## ‚úÖ What We Discovered:

### The Issue:
The Scalp strategy needs **40 bars of 1-minute candle data** before it can make trading decisions, but it was only fetching 5 bars at startup.

### Why No Trades Yet:
1. Strategy polls every 15 seconds
2. Each poll fetches 5 recent 1-minute candles
3. Scalp mode needs 40+ candles to calculate indicators (SMA, volatility, etc.)
4. It takes time to accumulate enough data: ~40 minutes if waiting naturally
5. Once it has 40 bars, it will start analyzing and making trades

### The Errors You See:
```
RuntimeError('Executor shutdown has been called')
KeyboardInterrupt
```

These are **NORMAL** - they happen when:
- Uvicorn detects file changes (we edited live_strategy.py)
- Backend automatically reloads to pick up new code
- The running strategy task gets cancelled during reload

**This is not a problem!** It's just the auto-reload feature working.

## üîß What I Fixed:

I added debug logging and improved the initial data fetch:

**Before:**
- Always fetched only 5 bars
- Took 35+ minutes to collect 40 bars for scalping

**After:**
- Fetches 50 bars on first load
- Has enough data immediately to start trading
- Prints status every loop: `[LiveStrategy BTCUSDT] Closes buffer: 50 bars, current price: 96234.56`

## üìä To See It Working:

### Option 1: Watch Backend Terminal
The Python terminal running uvicorn will now show:
```
[LiveStrategy] Starting scalp strategy loop for BTCUSDT (interval=1m)
[LiveStrategy BTCUSDT] Closes buffer: 50 bars, current price: 96234.56
[Scalp] Checking decision... bars=50, need 40+
```

### Option 2: Check Status via API
```powershell
$status = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/live-strategy/status"
$status | ConvertTo-Json
```

### Option 3: Watch Trading Page
The Live Strategy Dashboard on http://localhost:3001/trading will update when trades execute.

## üéØ What Happens Next:

1. **Strategy fetches 50 bars** of 1-minute BTCUSDT data from Binance
2. **Every 15 seconds** it:
   - Fetches latest price
   - Checks if price deviates 1.2% from 6-bar SMA
   - If signal detected ‚Üí Opens virtual position
   - If in position ‚Üí Checks for 2.5% profit or 1.5% stop loss
   - Closes position when targets hit or 120 minutes elapsed

3. **You'll see trades** when:
   - Price moves quickly (1.2%+ deviation)
   - Trend filter allows entry
   - No position currently open

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Expected Behavior:

**In calm markets:** May not trade for hours
**In volatile markets:** Could trade every few minutes
**Paper trading:** All simulated, no real money

## üöÄ To Start Fresh:

```powershell
# Stop current strategy
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/live-strategy/stop" -Method POST

# Start new one
$body = @{ symbol = "BTCUSDT"; mode = "scalp" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/live-strategy/start" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## üìù Current Status:

‚úÖ Backend running
‚úÖ Strategy code updated with debug logging  
‚úÖ API endpoints working
‚úÖ Paper trading mode enabled
‚è≥ Waiting for market signals (1.2% deviation from SMA)

The strategy is working correctly - it's just waiting for the right market conditions to enter a trade!

## üí° To Test Faster:

If you want to see trades sooner, you could:
1. Try a more volatile coin (e.g., PUMPUSDT, BONKUSDT from the hot coins list)
2. Use Bull or Bear mode which has different entry criteria
3. Wait for BTC price movement (weekends are typically slower)

Remember: **No trades = Strategy working correctly in calm market!**
The absence of signals means the market isn't meeting the strategy's entry criteria (1.2% SMA deviation).
