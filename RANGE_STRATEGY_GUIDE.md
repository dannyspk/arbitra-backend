# Range/Grid Trading Strategy Guide

## Overview

The **Range/Grid Strategy** is designed for sideways markets where price oscillates within a defined range. It's ideal for low-volatility, mean-reverting conditions where the market is consolidating between support and resistance levels.

## How It Works

### Core Concept
- **Buy low, sell high** within a defined price range
- Places buy orders near support (lower band)
- Places sell orders near resistance (upper band)
- Multiple positions can be opened at different price levels (grid-style)
- Exits when price breaks out of the range or hits profit targets

### Key Indicators

1. **Bollinger Bands** (20-period, 2 std dev)
   - Identifies dynamic support/resistance
   - Upper band = resistance zone
   - Lower band = support zone

2. **Support/Resistance Detection**
   - Analyzes recent 50 bars to find range highs/lows
   - Requires minimum 3% range size to trade

3. **Volatility Filter**
   - Max 2% volatility threshold
   - Avoids trading during high volatility breakouts

### Entry Rules

**Long Entry (Buy):**
- Price near lower Bollinger Band
- Price at or below calculated grid buy level
- Within 1% of support level
- Volatility below threshold

**Short Entry (Sell):**
- Price near upper Bollinger Band
- Price at or above resistance level
- Within 1% of resistance level
- Volatility below threshold

### Exit Rules

**Take Profit:**
- 1.5% profit per grid level
- Long: Exit when price rises to sell level
- Short: Exit when price falls to buy level

**Stop Loss:**
- 2.5% stop loss on range breakout
- Long: Exit if price breaks below support
- Short: Exit if price breaks above resistance

## Strategy Parameters

### Default Configuration
```python
notional_per_level: $150      # Position size per grid level
lookback_bars: 50             # Bars to analyze for range
bb_period: 20                 # Bollinger Band period
bb_std: 2.0                   # BB standard deviations

```

### Time Frame
- **15-minute candles** for range detection
- Provides good balance between noise filtering and responsiveness

## When to Use Range Strategy

### ‚úÖ Ideal Conditions
- **Sideways/Consolidating Markets**
  - Price trading in horizontal range
  - Clear support and resistance levels
  - Low trending momentum

- **Low Volatility Periods**
  - Stable price action
  - Narrow Bollinger Bands
  - Predictable oscillation

- **Mean-Reverting Assets**
  - Assets that bounce between levels
  - Strong support/resistance zones
  - Stable liquidity

### ‚ùå Avoid When
- **Strong Trending Markets**
  - Clear uptrend or downtrend
  - Breaking new highs/lows
  - Expanding Bollinger Bands

- **High Volatility**
  - Sharp price swings
  - Wide Bollinger Bands
  - News events/announcements

- **Narrow Ranges**
  - Range less than 3%
  - Insufficient profit potential
  - High risk/reward ratio

## Grid Trading Mechanics

### Grid Levels
The strategy divides the range into multiple levels:

```
Resistance ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Sell Zone (Short)
              ‚Üì
Level 3 Buy ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
              ‚Üì               ‚îÇ 1.5% profit
Level 3 Sell ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚Üì
Level 2 Buy ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
              ‚Üì               ‚îÇ 1.5% profit
Level 2 Sell ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚Üì
Level 1 Buy ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
              ‚Üì               ‚îÇ 1.5% profit
Level 1 Sell ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚Üì
Support ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Buy Zone (Long)
```

### Position Management
- **Max 3 concurrent positions** to limit exposure
- Each level trades independently
- Positions close individually at targets
- All positions close on range breakout

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **6% of account equity** per position
- Calculated based on available balance
- Respects min ($20) and max ($1,500) limits

### Stop Loss Protection
- **2.5% stop loss** on range breakout
- Long positions stopped below support
- Short positions stopped above resistance
- Protects against false breakouts

### Profit Targets
- **1.5% profit per grid level**
- Net ~1.2% after fees (0.07% maker + 0.05% slippage)
- Multiple small wins accumulate over time

## Performance Optimization

### Grid Level Spacing
- Evenly distributed across range
- 1% buffer from exact support/resistance
- Prevents premature entries/exits

### Volatility Filtering
- Skips trades when volatility > 2%
- Avoids whipsaws during breakouts
- Preserves capital in uncertain conditions

### Range Validation
- Requires minimum 3% range size
- Ensures adequate profit potential
- Filters out noise/microranges

## Trading Example

### Scenario: BTC Ranging Between $50,000 - $51,500

**Range Setup:**
- Support: $50,000
- Resistance: $51,500
- Range Size: 3% ‚úÖ (meets minimum)
- BB Upper: $51,400
- BB Lower: $50,100

**Grid Levels Calculated:**
- Level 1 Buy: $50,400 ‚Üí Sell at $51,157 (1.5% profit)
- Level 2 Buy: $50,900 ‚Üí Sell at $51,663 (1.5% profit)
- Level 3 Buy: $51,400 ‚Üí Sell at $52,170 (1.5% profit)

**Trade Execution:**
1. Price drops to $50,400 ‚Üí **Open Long** (Level 1)
2. Price rises to $51,157 ‚Üí **Close Long** (+1.5%)
3. Price drops to $50,900 ‚Üí **Open Long** (Level 2)
4. Price drops to $50,400 ‚Üí **Open Long** (Level 1 again)
5. Both positions profit as price recovers
6. If price breaks below $49,750 (support - 2.5%) ‚Üí **Close All** (Stop Loss)

**Result:** Multiple small profits from range oscillations

### 1. Identify Valid Ranges
- Look for at least 3-5 touches of support/resistance
- Prefer horizontal ranges over slanted
- Avoid recent breakout zones

### 2. Monitor Range Health
- Check Bollinger Band width
- Watch for narrowing bands (compression)
- Increasing volatility = potential breakout

- Don't force trades in unclear ranges
- Respect max position limits
- Scale down size in questionable setups

### 4. Exit on Breakouts
- Don't fight confirmed breakouts
- Accept stop losses quickly
- Switch to trend-following strategy if range breaks

### 5. Combine with Other Indicators
- Volume analysis (high volume on touches)
- RSI oscillations (oversold/overbought)
- Time of day patterns (avoid news events)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Trading Fake Ranges
- **Problem:** Identifying range in trending market
- **Solution:** Wait for at least 20+ bars of consolidation

### ‚ùå Ignoring Volatility
- **Problem:** Trading during high volatility
- **Solution:** Respect the 2% volatility filter

### ‚ùå Too Tight Stop Loss

- **Solution:** Use 2.5% stop loss with 1% buffer

### ‚ùå Overtrading
- **Problem:** Opening too many positions
- **Solution:** Respect 3 position maximum

### ‚ùå Holding Through Breakouts
- **Problem:** Hoping range will hold
- **Solution:** Exit immediately on confirmed breakout
