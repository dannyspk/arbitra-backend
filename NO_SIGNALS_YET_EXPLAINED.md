## 🔍 What Each Strategy Needs

### ⚡ BTCUSDT Scalp Strategy

**Entry Requirements:**
1. ✅ 40+ bars of 1-minute data (takes ~5 minutes from start)
2. ⏳ Price must move **1.2%+ away** from 6-period SMA
3. ⏳ Trend filter must align (long-term trend supports direction)
4. ⏳ Momentum filter must pass (no strong bearish momentum for longs)
5. ⏳ Support/Resistance: Price near key levels
6. ⏳ Higher timeframe: 12h/24h momentum confirmation

**Current Market Behavior:**
- BTCUSDT likely trading **within 1.2% of SMA** → No entry signal
- Market is calm/stable → Strategy waiting for volatility

**Example Signal Conditions:**
```
If BTCUSDT SMA = $97,000
AND price drops to $95,836 (1.2% below) 
AND all filters pass
→ Signal: open_long
```

### 🐻 AIAUSDT Bear Strategy

**Entry Requirements:**
1. **Short Entry (Counter-trend):** Price pumps **+5%** in 15 minutes
2. **Long Entry (Oversold):** Price dumps **-5%, -10%, or -12%** in 15/30/60 minutes

**Current Market Behavior:**
- AIAUSDT not moving +5% or -5%+ → No entry signal
- Waiting for significant price spike or crash

**Example Signal Conditions:**
```
If AIAUSDT suddenly pumps +5.2% in 15 minutes
→ Signal: open_short (bet on reversion)

If AIAUSDT crashes -10% in 30 minutes  
→ Signal: open_long (buy the dip)
```

---

### 🐻 COAIUSDT Bear Strategy

**Same as AIAUSDT** - waiting for +5% pump or -5/-10/-12% dumps.

---

## 🕐 How Long Should You Wait?

| Time Elapsed | Expected Behavior | Action |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **0-15 min** | No signals (strategies still warming up) | ✅ Normal - wait |
| **15-60 min** | No signals (calm market) | ✅ Normal - monitor |
| **1-3 hours** | No signals (very calm market) | ✅ Normal - this is fine |
| **3-6 hours** | Still no signals (extremely calm) | 💡 Consider more volatile pairs |
| **6+ hours** | No signals (market dead) | 💡 Try different symbols/timeframes |

**Current Status:** Your strategies just started, so 0 signals is **100% expected**.

## 🎯 How to Monitor for Signals

### Option 1: Use Real-Time Monitor Script (Best)
```powershell
# Run this in a terminal - it auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
.\monitor_signals.ps1

# Or with faster refresh (5 seconds)
.\monitor_signals.ps1 -RefreshSeconds 5

# Or with debug info
.\monitor_signals.ps1 -ShowDebug
```

**Features:**
- 🔄 Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
- 🔔 Beeps when new signal appears
- 📊 Shows positions, P&L, statistics
- 🎨 Color-coded display

### Option 2: Check Trading Page UI
Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/trading
- Scroll to **"Live Strategy Dashboard"** section
- Watch **"Recent Signals"** panel (refreshes every 2 seconds)

### Option 3: Manual API Check
```powershell
# Quick status check
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/dashboard" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

## 💡 Tips to Get Signals Faster

### 1. Choose More Volatile Symbols
Current: BTCUSDT (moderate volatility)
Try: PUMPUSDT, BONKUSDT, PEPEUSDT (high volatility meme coins)

### 2. Use Shorter Timeframes
Current: 1-minute (slow in calm markets)
Try: 15-second scalp (if supported)

### 3. Loosen Entry Criteria (Advanced)
Edit strategy parameters:
- Scalp: Lower entry_threshold from 1.2% to 0.8%
- Bear: Lower pump threshold from 5% to 3%

**⚠️ Warning:** Looser criteria = more signals but potentially lower quality

### 4. Add More Symbols
Start strategies on 5-10 different coins to increase chances of catching moves:
```powershell
.\start_multiple_strategies.ps1
# Start strategies on: BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, XRP, DOGE, SHIB, PEPE
```

## 🔔 When Will First Signal Appear?

### Most Likely Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Market Spike (High Probability)**
```
Time: Next 1-3 hours
Trigger: News, whale move, or natural volatility
Expected: AIAUSDT or COAIUSDT catches a +5% pump
Result: open_short signal generated
```

**Scenario 2: Gradual Drift (Medium Probability)**
```
Time: Next 2-6 hours  
Trigger: BTCUSDT slowly drifts 1.2%+ from SMA
Expected: BTCUSDT scalp triggers
Result: open_long or open_short signal
```

**Scenario 3: Market Stays Calm (Low Probability)**
```
Time: 6+ hours
Trigger: Low volatility, weekend lull
Expected: No signals for extended period
Result: Normal - wait or try different symbols
```
